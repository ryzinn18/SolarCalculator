The Solar Calculator follows a 3 tier layered architecture. These layers are the Presentation Layer, the Business/Persistence Layer, and the Database layer. Additionally, this project uses a handful of 3rd party Python libraries including Pydantic, Pandas, PyTest, and Flask, and utilizes Amazon Web Services (AWS) tools such as Lambda, EC2, S3, and DynamoDB for it's hosting. This section describes the design and tech stack that comprise this project.

    Presentation Layer
</h4>
<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
    This is the user interface you are using now and includes all of the browser communication logic that make this frontend functional. This layer was developed using the Flask framework for Python. This layer is hosted via an AWS EC2 instance running Ubuntu. This EC2 instance was configured via SSH command line tools as a web server using Nginx, and an application server using Gunicorn. When you enter your information on the home page, this layer takes that information and sends it to the next layer, the Business/Persistence Layer.

<h4 class="text-white mt-0">
    Business/Persistence Layer
</h4>
<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
    This layer is responsible for taking the user’s input and calculating their response. The steps involved in this layer are described in detail in the above Business section. This layer is hosted via AWS Lambda and is called by the Presentation Layer via the AWS SDK. There is also the maintenance component to this layer which contains business logic to remove expired data generated by users. These actions are called chronologically via AWS CloudWatch Events.<br><br>
    All data validation in this step is handled via the Pydantic library; API calls made to 3rd party resources are handled via the Requests library; testing conducted in this layer is facilitated via the PyTest library; graphs generated for the final results are made with MathPlotLib; and structured data manipulation is facilitated with the Pandas library.

<h4 class="text-white mt-0">
    Database Layer
</h4>
<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
    This layer is called by the Business/Persistence layer and is chiefly responsible for storing all of the data necessary for this web application to function. When the Presentation layer is initially invoked by a user’s input, the user’s input data is stored for logging purposes in a DynamoDB table. Next, as results are generated by the Business/Persistence layer, including the graphs and results data, they are written here. Objects like the graphs (.png) and results document (.csv) are stored in S3 buckets while the more raw results data are stored in JSON format in a DynamoDB table.

<h4 class="text-white mt-0">
    Process
</h4>
<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
    The overall process sees data moving down the hierarchy of layers then back up to serve the user with their results. In some cases, the Database layer and Presentation layer skip over the Business/Persistence layer for more direct data storage/serving, making the Business/Persistence layer an Open layer. The two cases it does this is seen when the Presentation layer logs the input data before invoking the Business/Persistence layer. The second case is seen when the application presents the results data; the application's frontend receives the graph objects directly from the database layers, rather than having to buffer the images through the Business/Persistence layer. These design choices were made for the sake of data integrity, in the case of the input data being logged initially, and for efficiency, with respect to the images being served from their S3 buckets directly.
